    "paragraph": "Under the slogan RUA, I am Tina Zadravec, Master of Art Therapy and a graduate occupational therapist. With decades of experience, I connect knowledge from university studies and additional professional training to ensure an individualized approach and treatment for each person.\n\nI co-create moments when users say: \"I haven’t had so many ideas and information about the possibilities that exist in a long time!\"\nWe help people rebuild the belief that they, too, can perform everyday activities that have long seemed impossible.\n \nWithin occupational therapy, we work in the field of [re]habilitation of individuals with neurological and musculoskeletal difficulties, as well as challenges in mental health. We value knowledge and wisdom and thoughtfully introduce new approaches and therapeutic tools into our work. We also collaborate with professionals from abroad.\nWe are active members of the Chamber of Occupational Therapists of Slovenia and the Slovenian Association of Art Therapists.",

As an occupational therapist, I am also here to guide you through the components needed to perform activities in the areas of basic daily living — such as independent washing, dressing, and eating.\n\nWe will also look at participation in broader daily activities, assess environmental risk factors, work on fall prevention, and provide advice on adapting the home for greater safety. With the individual, we will discuss the use of orthotic and medical-technical aids, and with family members, we will talk about supportive technology that can help the person maintain independence.",
